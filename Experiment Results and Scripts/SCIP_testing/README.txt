This directory contains all the datasets except the Protein dataset used in our paper "Pattern Based Sequence Classification". Because the Protein dataset was obtained from PhosphoELM (http://phospho.elm.eu.org/) and it's not allowed to publish to the third party.
It contains four shell scripts that contains the settings used to run the softwares.

1. There are four softwares: SCII.jar, SCIS.jar, CBS.jar, and BayesFM.jar.

2. There are four four shell scripts for testing: SCII_maxsize.sh, SCIS_maxsize.sh, CBS_maxsize.sh, and BayesFM_maxsize.sh

3. Running the Experiments in Linux, Unix or Mac OS operation system
If you are using Linux, Unix or Mac OS operation system, you can use the command:
sh SCII_maxsize.sh
in the terminal/console to run the experiments. It might be necessary to tweak the file according to your preferences.
